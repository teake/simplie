* [ui] Added TeX export capability of various matrices.
* [ui] Some interface options get disabled when appropriate.
* [misc] Added a Windows installer for easier installation.

13-05-2008: Version 1.1

* [math] Faster root system construction, by not calculating multiplicities of roots on the same orbit (with thanks to Axel Kleinschmidt, who pointed this out to me).
* [math] All simple roots now have even integer norms.
* [math] Take into account that weight heights can be fractional too.
* [math] Sort levels according to their height.
* [ui] Remember window positions and sizes.
* [ui] Brand-new root system visualization tab.
* [ui] Extended help.
* [ui] Adding a node connection has a preview.
* [ui] Show Dynkin diagram and Cartan matrix on same tab.
* [code] Moved from Java 6 to Java 5.
* [code] Renamed packages and some classes.
* [misc] Numerous bug-fixes and interface improvements.

18-10-2007: Version 1.0

* [math] SimpLie can now handle non-simply laced algebras.
* [math] Automatic detection of the type of diagram, including direct products.
* [math] Sort levels prior to scanning according to their sum squared.
* [ui] Algebra presets are now customizable by the user.
* [ui] Added a context menu to the Dynkin diagram interaction panel.
* [ui] Added a preview node to the dynkin diagram.
* [ui] Added status-feedback in the diagram panel.
* [ui] Added big algebra-info tab.
* [ui] Added extra column to rep table: h'. It contains the height of the root associated to the highest weight state.
* [ui] Added 'show exotic fields' option. Useful for truncating results that have more indices than the number of space time dimensions.
* [misc] Increased perfomance by > 50%.
* [misc] Lock the diagram and disable sign convention buttons when scanning.
* [misc] Released under the GPL v3 license.
