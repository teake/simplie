SimpLie is an easy-to-use program for Lie algebra. It has been specifically written for level decompositions of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, but it is not limited to that task. Its current features are:

  * Calculation of Lie algebra properties based on Dynkin diagrams:
    1. Type
    1. Dimension
    1. Rank
    1. (Dual) Coxeter labels and numbers.
    1. Roots
  * Calculation of highest weight representations.
  * Level decompositions.
  * Visualization of root systems by means of [Coxeter projections and Hasse diagrams](Screenshots.md).

On the user end, it has the following benefits:

  * A graphical user interface, making it easy to use.
  * Cross-platform (written in Java).
  * LaTeX & EPS export capability.
  * Saving and loading of calculation results (root systems).

See [here](https://code.google.com/p/simplie/wiki/Papers) for a list of papers that have used SimpLie.

Here is the root system of E10 as visualized by SimpLie:
