#summary Instruction on how to build SimpLie from scratch.

= Build instructions =

== Gradle ==

If you have [http://www.gradle.org/ Gradle], building and running SimpLie amounts to just checking out the source and running the `run` Gradle task:

{{{
svn checkout http://simplie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ simplie-read-only

cd simplie-read-only

gradle run
}}}


== Netbeans ==

SimpLie can also be build with [https://netbeans.org/ NetBeans]. If you want to edit the GUI panels you'll need to get NetBeans 7, as older version have dropped support for the Swing Application Framework which SimpLie uses.

You will also need to create three libraries upon which SimpLie relies, namely:
